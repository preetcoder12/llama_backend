# 🔧 Ollama Model Loading Fixes

## 🚨 Issues Identified
Based on your Render logs, the main issues were:
1. **Model loading timeout**: `Model llama3.2:1b exists but not ready: timeout of 10000ms exceeded`
2. **Client connection closed**: `client connection closed before server finished loading, aborting load`
3. **Load failed**: `timed out waiting for llama runner to start: context canceled`

## ✅ Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Increased Timeout Values** (`server.js`)
- **Model test timeout**: 10s → 60s
- **Chat request timeout**: 30s → 120s  
- **Vibe recommendations timeout**: 120s → 180s
- **Ollama service check timeout**: 5s → 10s

### 2. **Added Retry Logic** (`server.js`)
- **3 retry attempts** for model loading checks
- **10-second delays** between retries for model readiness
- **5-second delays** between retries for Ollama service
- **Exponential backoff** for better reliability

### 3. **Optimized Dockerfile** (`Dockerfile`)
- **Extended Ollama startup wait**: 30 attempts → 60 attempts (3s each = 3 minutes)
- **Added model pull retry logic**: 3 attempts with 5-minute timeout each
- **Added model readiness test**: 10 attempts to verify model can handle requests
- **Better error handling** throughout the startup process

### 4. **Enhanced Health Check** (`server.js`)
- **Async health check** that actually tests Ollama readiness
- **Proper HTTP status codes**: 200 for ready, 503 for loading
- **Detailed status information** including model name and readiness state

### 5. **Added Render Configuration** (`render.yaml`)
- **Proper health check path**: `/health`
- **Environment variables** for Ollama configuration
- **Docker deployment** with optimized settings

### 6. **Server Startup Delay** (`server.js`)
- **30-second delay** before starting Express server
- **Gives Ollama time** to initialize and load models
- **Prevents premature health check failures**

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Use the deployment script
```bash
./deploy-render.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual deployment
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Ollama model loading timeouts"
git push origin main
```

## 📊 Expected Results

### Before Fixes:
- ❌ Model loading timeouts after 10 seconds
- ❌ Client connections closed during loading
- ❌ Health checks failing immediately
- ❌ 499 status codes from premature requests

### After Fixes:
- ✅ Model loading with 60+ second timeouts
- ✅ Retry logic handles temporary failures
- ✅ Health checks wait for model readiness
- ✅ Proper 503 status during loading, 200 when ready
- ✅ Graceful handling of model download delays

## 🔍 Monitoring

### Check Deployment Status:
1. **Render Dashboard**: Monitor build and deployment logs
2. **Health Endpoint**: `GET /health` - Returns detailed status
3. **Status Endpoint**: `GET /api/status` - Shows Ollama and model status

### Expected Log Messages:
```
[DEBUG] Checking Ollama at: http://127.0.0.1:11434 (attempt 1/4)
[DEBUG] Available models: ["llama3.2:1b"]
[DEBUG] Model is ready for inference!
🚀 Llama 3 Backend API is running on port 3000
```

## ⏱️ Timeline Expectations

- **Initial deployment**: 5-10 minutes (model download)
- **Subsequent deployments**: 2-3 minutes
- **Cold starts**: 30-60 seconds (model loading)
- **Warm requests**: < 5 seconds

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. **Check Render logs** for specific error messages
2. **Verify model name** in environment variables
3. **Monitor health endpoint** for detailed status
4. **Check memory usage** (Render free tier has 1GB limit)
5. **Consider using smaller model** if memory issues persist

## 📝 Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in Render:
```
OLLAMA_URL=http://localhost:11434
MODEL_NAME=llama3.2:1b
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=production
```

The fixes should resolve the timeout issues you were experiencing! 🎉
